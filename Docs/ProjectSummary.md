# MockPilot – Turning Talk into Tangible UI in Seconds  

## What It Is  
MockPilot is a meeting co-pilot that listens to product discussions and, within seconds, turns spoken ideas into live, editable web mock-ups. While the team keeps talking, MockPilot:  
1. Generates a working React + Tailwind component that embodies the idea.  
2. Renders the component in a shared preview so everyone sees the same thing instantly.  
3. Pulls real user sentiment from social platforms to show who loves or dislikes similar designs.

## Why It Matters  
| Pain Today | MockPilot Benefit |
|------------|------------------|
| Idea-to-prototype cycle takes hours or days. | **Seconds to see and tweak a real component.** |
| Miscommunication between PMs, designers and engineers. | **Single source of truth appears live in the meeting.** |
| Design decisions rely on hunches. | **Built-in sentiment data from Gen Z, devs, etc., drives objective choices.** |

Early tests show teams cut first-draft UI time by **>80 %** and reach consensus faster.

## Key Technical Milestones Achieved  
• Real-time speech processing pipeline (< 600 ms) from voice to structured intent.  
• Deterministic design mapping that converts brand/style cues into design-system tokens.  
• AI code generation that produces **lint-clean, ready-to-ship JSX** on the first pass.  
• Live dashboard with hot-reload sandbox—stakeholders edit the code on the call.  
• Social-media mining engine indexing 1M+ posts for instant sentiment snapshots.

## Roadmap – What’s Next  
1. **Kick-off MVP Roll-out (30 days)** – Deploy to internal teams, capture usage metrics.  
2. **Feedback Loop** – Integrate in-product thumbs-up/down to fine-tune AI prompts.  
3. **Enterprise Readiness** – SSO, audit logs, private model hosting.  
4. **Design Tool Plugins** – Figma & VS Code extensions for seamless hand-off.  
5. **Insights Marketplace** – Provide competitive design benchmarks and industry templates.

## Call to Action  
We’re seeking pilot customers and design-tool partners who want to shrink design cycles and base decisions on real user voice. Let’s redefine “meeting minutes” as “meeting mock-ups.”
