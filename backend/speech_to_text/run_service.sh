# 1. Poetry installed (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
# 2. Dependencies installed via `poetry install` in the `backend/speech_to_text` directory.
# 3. An OpenAI API key set in a `.env` file in the `backend/speech_to_text` directory.

#    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
#    LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG # Optional, for more verbose logging

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
