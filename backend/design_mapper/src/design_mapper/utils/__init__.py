# This file makes the 'utils' directory a Python sub-package
# within the 'design_mapper' service.

# It will typically contain utility functions and helper classes
# that support the design mapper's core functionality, such as:
# - File watching for hot-reloading the mappings.json
# - JSON processing and transformation utilities
# - Caching mechanisms for mapping results
# - Error handling and validation helpers
